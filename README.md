# POSTMessages to SQS

This Spring Boot application demonstrates how to dynamically create an AWS SQS (Simple Queue Service) queue if it does not already exist and provides a RESTful endpoint to post messages to the SQS queue. The project uses Java 17 and Gradle.



## Prerequisites

- **Java 17**: Ensure JDK 17 is installed on your machine.
- **Gradle**: Make sure Gradle is installed for build automation.
- **AWS Account**: You need an AWS account with SQS service enabled and appropriate credentials.
